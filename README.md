# YoutubeIR-Project
Control your mouse using an IR remote and other functions using Python and Arduino 

The arduino code lets you read IR receiver data from the Arduino and then send custom data over the serial bus. 
This data is then read by the Python program which then translates it to other functions that you can implement accordingly.
